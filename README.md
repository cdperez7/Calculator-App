I created this calculator app to showcase basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS design in a simple format. Styling was based on the standard iPhone calculator. The calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with use of decimal points. The calculator supports continuous operations that are saved until cleared. Users may also use a backspace key to delete the last number entered if it was an accident. Styled with a hover feature that will light up the digit orange when selected. Below is a gif of the calculator in use to see it in use.
